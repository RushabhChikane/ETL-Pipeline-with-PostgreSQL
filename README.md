# ETL-Pipeline-with-PostgreSQL
Developed an end-to-end ETL pipeline for analyzing income data using Python, PostgreSQL, and Tableau.
Extracted raw data from the UCI ML Repository, pre-processed and transformed it in Google Colab, then
loaded the refined data into PostgreSQL for structured storage. Created insightful visualizations in Tableau,
highlighting key income trends across various demographics.
